# Netflix-Insights
This project dives deep into Netflix's content catalog using PostgreSQL to uncover insights. It includes queries for content categorization, actor analysis, genre exploration, and year-wise release patterns.

### Problems Addressed:

```sql
-- 1. No. of Movies Vs TV Shows

-- 2. Most common rating for Movies and TV shows

-- 3. Movies released in 2020

-- 4. Top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix

-- 5. Identify the longest movie

-- 6. Content added in the last 5 years

-- 7. Movies/TV Shows by the Director Steven Spielberg

-- 8. TV Shows that lasted longer than 5 seasons

-- 9. Content in each Genre

-- 10. Average amount of content released by US each year on Netflix

-- 11. Movies that are documentaries

-- 12. Content without director

-- 13. Track Meryl Streep movies in the last 10 years

-- 14. Top 10 actors who appeared in the most number of movies in the US

-- 15. Categorize the content based on the presence of the keywords 'kill' and 'violence' in 
-- the description field. Label content containing these keywords as 'Bad' and all other 
-- content as 'Good'. Count how many items fall into each category.
